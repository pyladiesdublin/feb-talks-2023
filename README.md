## TALKS
### Talk 1: Three Quick, Easy and No-Scraper ways of Getting Text Data using Python
(15 mins) Tired of using the same old data in the tutorials? Text data is abundant but it is difficult to scrape them all! In this talk, I will present three easy-to-use Python libraries that will enable you to build your own datasets and add a unique spin to your data science projects.

### Talk 2: I ❤️ VisiData
(20 mins) VisiData (https://www.visidata.org) is a powerful text based tabular data tool. Think of it like vim for spreadsheets or a command line Excel.

Michael has been using VisiData for years to quickly pivot through random datasets before doing deeper analysis. He's used it for crunching through access logs to pull out suspicious activities for further security analysis, debugging TCP traffic using flow logs and used it with scripts to understand JSON data.

In this talk Michael will run through VisiData, some of the features he commonly uses (along with the keyboard shortcuts!), the plugins available and some scripting he does with it.

### About Michael Twomey
Michael has been working professionally as a software engineer for over twenty years, with a strong emphasis on Python and systems design.
He's watched many systems fail in ways which were loudly declared to be "impossible" just the day before.
He has moved back and forth between coding and infrastructure operations, frequently using experience from both to solve problems.
